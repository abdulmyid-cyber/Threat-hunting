Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
Remote Access Trojans are a form of malware that allows an attacker to gain complete control over a victim's computer. Threat hunters can use the following queries to discover command and control (C2) servers for these RATs.
product:"XtremeRAT": This query identifies servers running the XtremeRAT, a remote access trojan that allows for extensive control over an infected machine, including file manipulation, keylogging, and webcam access.
product:"DarkComet": This searches for servers hosting the DarkComet RAT, a tool that provides a wide array of functionalities to remotely control a system, such as desktop capture, password recovery, and network functions.
product:"Gh0st RAT": This query locates C2 servers for the Gh0st RAT, a well-known trojan primarily used for espionage and has been active for over a decade.[1][4][5][6][7] Its source code is publicly available, leading to numerous variants.
product:"NanoCore RAT": Use this query to find C2 servers for the NanoCore RAT, a modular trojan that allows attackers to add various plugins to extend its capabilities, such as stealing credentials and spying on users.[8]
product:"Remcos Pro RAT": This query helps in identifying servers for Remcos (Remote Control & Surveillance), a commercial RAT that is often used for malicious purposes, offering features like keylogging, screen recording, and remote command execution.
product:"njRAT": This query is used to find servers controlling the njRAT, a prevalent and feature-rich trojan that can be used to manage files, registry, and processes on an infected system.[1][2]
product:"Ares RAT": This will search for command and control servers for the Ares RAT.
